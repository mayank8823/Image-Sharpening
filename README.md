# Image Sharpening Techniques
This repository explores various image sharpening techniques implemented in Python using OpenCV. The goal is to enhance the clarity and details in images using different sharpening methods.

## Techniques Implemented
#### 1. Unsharp Masking:
- The unsharp masking technique involves creating a blurred version of the original image and then subtracting it to enhance edges and fine details.

#### 2. High-Pass Filtering:
- High-pass filtering allows high-frequency components, such as edges and details, to pass through, effectively enhancing image sharpness.

#### 3. Laplacian Sharpening:
- Laplacian sharpening involves applying a Laplacian filter to highlight areas of rapid intensity change, emphasizing edges in the image.

#### 4. Histogram Equalization:
- Histogram equalization is used to enhance the contrast of an image by redistributing pixel intensities across the entire range.

#### 5. Non-Local Means (NLM) Filtering:
- Non-Local Means is a denoising algorithm that indirectly contributes to image sharpening by reducing noise and enhancing details.

## Getting Started
